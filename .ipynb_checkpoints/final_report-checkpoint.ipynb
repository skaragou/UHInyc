    "The urban heat island effect is a phenomenon where temperatures in cities are quite higher than those found in surrounding suburban and rural areas. The phenomenon is especially accute in large dense urban areas during summers. The higher temperatures can be attributed to the lack of geenery such as trees, a large concentration of cement and a high-use of heat-inducing equipment, such as air conditioners. Greenery tend to lower temperatures due to the release of humidity, as well as, in the case of trees, creating a canopy for the streetscape, so as to provide shade. A concentration of cement and asphalt leads to higher average tempatures, as both materials trap heat from direct sunlight and slowly release the heat throughout the night, as surfaces slowly cool down. The effect is that many areas that suffer from the UHI effect most severly have little relief from the heat at night. Lastly, the use of equipment such as air conditioners and cars, directly contribute heat to surrounding environments, which in conjunction with the other contributors to the urban heat island effect, lifts urban temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UHI effect is important to study, as in the near future, due to climate change, summers may become warmer and cities that suffer from the effect more accutely may face upticks in heat strokes among the most vulnerable populations. The Urban Heat Island effect has been studied in many cities around the world and New York City has been one of the cities that have been studied throughouly. This is due to the fact that there are large temperature disparities within the city itself. Specifically, neighborhoods that tend to be lower income tend to have the highest summer temperatures. This may be due to the fact that wealthier neighborhoods tend to have a larger density of trees, while poorer neighborhoods lack investment in their respective urban environemnt. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to model the urban heat island effect. Specifically, this project attempts to oberve the effect of density, tree canopy, building height and proximity to parks on the temperature in New York City throughout the day. Prior studies have tried to model the phenomenon through surface temperatures computed from satellite imagery. This project differs in that NYC captures hourly temperatures of multiple locations and hence using this data, it may possible to get a more accurate picture of the effects of these variables on temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work (Yin et al. 2018) that has investigated the effects of these effects on the urban heat island effect through causal inference using regressions using techniques similar to those found in econometrics. In order to encode the causal assumptions for this report to allow for causal interpretation of coefficients, a Pearlean causal diagram is provided below."

    "Using this latitude and longitude of location of a sensor, it is possible to create metrics for various factors that contribute to the UHI effect. Specifcally, using the Tree census data, the metric **num_trees_15**, which is the count of trees in a 15 meter radius around a sensor. This could be seen as a measure of tree canopy around the sensor. The minimum distance to a park from a given sensor was created **min_distance_park** variable. Lastly, there are two measures of building density around a sensor that was created for this project. Firstly, **num_build50** represents the number of buildings within a 50m radius of a sensor. The idea behind this variable is that the mode buildings there are, the higher the density is in the region. The second building variable is **mean_fa_ratio**, which is the mean floor area ratio of buildings within the 50m radius of a sensor. The floor-area ratio, is the height of the building divided by the area of the building. It becomes a metric for the height of the building in proportion to the amount of space the building takes up on the street. Hence, floor-area ratio will be another functino of density, albeit with the addition of quantifying the height of buildings surrounding sensors. \n",

Specifically, it seems, while the mean and median are acceptable, the minimum, maximum and variance of the model are off. I hypothesize this is due to the inherent issue of the indepdent variables not explaining much of the variation in the temperature sensors. Unlike the observations made in the paper, which used satellite imagery, temperature sensors are suceptible to a myriad of environmental factors which are not measured in the dataset I created. Some variables that could be factors could be: cloud coverage, shade, and sensor accuracy."
